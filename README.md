Up until now I was having trouble with cloning a repository to my computer. I had a tutoring session where we figured out what worked on my computer.

I looked up this code included in the starter file:
    # Print a loading indicator (for large datasets)
    print(". ", end="")
I added the end="" on all print statements for consistency.

To generate the output summaries to the terminal as the code was built, I googled and asked Xpert how to format it into multiple lines and found the syntax for newline characters (\n) rather than using the quotes we learned in class so it felt more natural to build the print output line by line.

I used Xpert to look up Rounding and f-strings.
"The .3f in the code you provided is a format specifier used within an f-string in Python. It specifies how to format a floating-point number."

I used X-pert to learn you cannot read and write into a csv file at the same time. Two separate "with open" statements. 

I used Copilot extension in Visual Studio to check that my code was correct and made sense as I went.
