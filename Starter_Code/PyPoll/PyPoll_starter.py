# create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
# The total number of votes cast
# A complete list of candidates who received votes
# The percentage of votes each candidate won
# The total number of votes each candidate won
# The winner of the election based on popular vote
# In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
